# SwiftJXL — Milestone 1 implementation and validation

Date: 18 September 2026. Common contract: **0.2.1**. Intended library release: **2.0.0**, not tagged.

## Scope and current status

This owner-assigned milestone implements the independent common API surface and owning-memory contract using newly written in-house Swift. There are no codec algorithms, compressed-format parsers, working encoders/decoders/transcoders, CLI or external runtime codec dependencies. Capability sets are empty and unsupported operations fail explicitly. The native `Transcoder` shape exists only in SwiftJ2K/SwiftJXL.

The descriptor supports unsigned little-endian single-plane greyscale16, with 1–16 declared meaningful bits, checked dimensions/offsets/strides/capacity, packed or padded rows and two-byte alignment. `OwnedImageStorage` allocates zero-initialised bytes and enforces available/writing/sealed/invalid states through one shared provider lifecycle. Synchronous scoped borrows, a retained write lease and an immutable sealed owner prevent overlapping writes and premature publication. External unsafe providers retain explicit caller responsibilities.

## Validation record

Compilation, tests and CI are pending at this revision. The editing environment is Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64 but has no Swift compiler; a direct attempt to download the official Swift 6.2 archive timed out at the network proxy. This is an unavailable local gate, not a test pass. The pull request's GitHub Actions jobs are the intended execution environment. This record will be updated with actual outcomes before milestone acceptance.

Run these commands from the repository root:

```sh
python3 Scripts/validate.py
python3 Scripts/check_url_consumer.py <published-commit-sha>
swift test -j 2 --scratch-path .build/asan --sanitize address
swift test -j 2 --scratch-path .build/tsan --sanitize thread
bash Scripts/validate_apple_sdks.sh
```

The first command records debug/release build and test exit codes, xUnit output, compiler/target information and the standalone public consumer outcome in `.validation/`. The URL consumer creates a fresh temporary package and resolves this repository at the supplied SHA; it does not discover siblings. CI uses the official Swift `6.2.0-noble` container on Ubuntu 24.04 and Xcode 26.0.1 for macOS/Apple SDK checks. Runner setup logs record actual runner/image revisions. Pinned action revisions and exact commands are in `.github/workflows/contract.yml`.

## Evidence boundaries and next milestone

Synthetic tests exercise storage and API behaviour only. They are not compressed-format interoperability, codec regression, throughput, real-transcode copy counts or medical validation. No comparative performance numbers are claimed. The default owner uses one zero-initialised allocation and small wrappers; metadata is budgeted separately. The private raw allocation's unchecked concurrency bridge carries its safety proof in source; public owners/leases use checked Sendable conformance.

Native device runtime tests, controlled performance baselines, parser fuzz campaigns and independent codec oracles remain later gates. Any CI jobs that did not execute or failed must be resolved or explicitly recorded; workflow presence never establishes support. Milestone 2 requires a separate assignment and begins with the pinned predecessor baseline/provenance inventory in HISTORY.md and IMPLEMENTATION.md.
