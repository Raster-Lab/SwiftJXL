# SwiftJXL

JPEG XL for the **Swift Image Compression Suite**.

**Status: Milestone 1 API and owning-memory implementation under validation.** The package contains a common API surface, validated greyscale16 storage and synthetic contract tests. Codec algorithms, working compression/decompression, transcoding and CLI are not implemented yet. The intended first stable library version remains **2.0.0**; no release is tagged.

SwiftJXL is the standalone successor to [JXLSwift](https://github.com/Raster-Lab/JXLSwift). The successor is intended to provide a harmonised API, explicit memory ownership, high-precision sample preservation and efficient shared-storage integration. It has no mandatory dependency on another suite library or CompressionFamily. MIT licensing applies to these documents and subsequent authorised in-house implementation; third-party material retains its own terms.

## Intended platform baseline

Swift 6.2 minimum, Swift 6 language mode and complete concurrency checking. Apple OS deployment minima: macOS, iOS/iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS and watchOS 26.0. Apple Silicon is the primary optimisation target. macOS x86_64 and Linux ARM64/x86_64 are included with cleanly separated platform/architecture support. Ubuntu 24.04 is the initial Linux engineering baseline. These are requirements, not completed qualification claims.

## Start reading

The current coding task is **Milestone 1: API and memory-contract feasibility**, using synthetic buffers. Codec migration and the first real shared-storage transcode follow in Milestones 2 and 3. Use the ready-to-use task prompt in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Native in-memory transcoding

Planned standalone **reversible existing-JPEG ↔ JPEG XL transcoding** restores the original JPEG bytes from the JXL alone, with coefficients and reconstruction metadata held in memory. The predecessor already exposes forward/reverse methods and byte-equality tests; the supported JPEG/metadata profiles still require qualification. This preserves an existing lossy JPEG without recovering pixels lost during its original encoding. See [transcoding instructions and source-review findings](TRANSCODING.md) for the API/CLI pattern, limits and acceptance tests. This remains planned successor functionality.

## Relationship to the suite

The four independent libraries are SwiftJ2K, SwiftJLS, SwiftJXL and SwiftJLI, all intended to live under Raster-Lab. A future optional umbrella adapts them for codec selection and in-process transcoding. The codecs do not depend on that umbrella. SwiftCompressionFamily is not part of this successor plan. The common contract is mirrored documentation plus behavioural tests, not a shared runtime package.

The package product and main module are `SwiftJXL` and the planned CLI is `swiftjxl`. Actual API usage examples will be published only after they compile and run. Features from the predecessor are migration candidates whose exact coverage must be verified; see IMPLEMENTATION.md. Nothing here changes the predecessor repository's current maintenance configuration.

## Building and validation

Read [Milestone 1 implementation and evidence](Documentation/MILESTONE_1.md). With Swift 6.2 installed, run `python3 Scripts/validate.py` to build and test the storage/API milestone and its standalone consumer. Unsupported codec calls fail explicitly; this package is not yet a usable compression release.
